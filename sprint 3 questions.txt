Sprint Challenge "JavaScript Fundamentals"

1. Briefly compare and contrast .forEach & .map (2-3 sentences max)

forEach does not return anything unless you ask it to. It also does not create a new array. 
.map on the other hand returns a new array with values that depend on the function.

2. Explain the difference between a callback and a higher order function.

A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function which is then 
called back at a later time.

A higher order function accepts other functions as arguments.

3. What is closure?

A closure is a function that uses references in its scope or surrounding state. 
This gives inner functions access to outer functions because it's in the same lexical 
environment.


4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

  1. Global binding to me is just a parameter or argument used in a function in substitute 
     so you can use any value you wish to use in the future.
  2. Implicit binding is one, and it means dot notation is used to invoke a function.
  3. Explicit binding is when .call(), apply(), or bind() are used on a function. It takes 
     all the keys/parameters from a constructor but then lets you add more keys yourself.
  4. A new binding looks like a function that is kind of like a factory. It has all the 
     tools needed to create multple items with all of the keys set. The bezt way to describe 
     it is how Pace created a Transformers constructor which had keys like color, speed, 
     catchphrase, etc. This function sets all the keys up for us, and later on we just 
     create different versions of that function with its own values.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

Super is used to call on the arguments/functions/properties that were in the parent class 
or the "factory" class. It then allows you to add other properties to the extended class.
